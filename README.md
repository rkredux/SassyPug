# SassyPug
This repo just contains some view templates created with Pug(Jade) html and Sass CSS preprocessor.
Ever since beginning Node, I keep running into indentation problems with Pug. So I decided to give this template engine
an hour of practice everyday together with including Sass preprocessor for styling. 
This is going to be of great help with Node application dev. I will post demo links when I am done completing a UI
built with pug and Sass.
